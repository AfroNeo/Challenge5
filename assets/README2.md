Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

At present I have created a password generator that will assign a random passowrd to the user. For example: when the user types in two digits such as "12" there will be a set of clickable prompts I have assigned such as asking the user if they want 'special characters'?

I put the password.length in a for loop to getRandom(possibleOptions) to generate a random password.

The random password then displays on the page.
